- Design A Page with Clickable buttons that play music ( drum music whenever you click on them )
- Also, make the button bigger every-time a button is clicked and border of the button should glow

## It's best to use 'transitionend' event , to get the button back to its original state by removing the class used for transition , after the transition is completed.
