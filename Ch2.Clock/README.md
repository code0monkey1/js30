## Transformation and Transition are the main things to use in this project

## The setInterval method is used to call a function every second, by which the clock is updated

```css
transform-origin: 100%;
transform: rotate(90deg);
```

these 2 css properties are used to rotate the clock ( the transform origin makes the axis of transformation to the extreme right , instead of the middle)

while , the transform property is used to rotate the clock by 90 degrees ( i.e where we want it : at 12 O'clock)
